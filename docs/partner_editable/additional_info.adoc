When the CloudFormation stack completed successfully, return to the Conformity console and all of your accounts will have been imported and the conformity bot will have begun scanning all of your AWS accounts to alert you about any misconfigurations or posture concerns!

== Post-deployment steps
// If post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading
As Conformity starts scanning your AWS accounts, most organizations will choose to prioritize high severity findings for investigation and remediation. 

*Keeping the Conformity role up to date:* The Conformity bot is continuously improved to enhance visibility or add coverage for new AWS services. On occasion a new IAM permission may be required for the role in each protected account. When a new role is available, organizations using this Conformity for AWS Control Tower integration can simply update the CloudFormation stack using the template URL provided above in the deployment steps section, and the role in all current and future enrolled accounts will be updated to the most recent version of the Conformity role.
