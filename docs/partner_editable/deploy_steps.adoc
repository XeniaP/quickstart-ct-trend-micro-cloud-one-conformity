=== Confirm your AWS account configuration

. Sign in to your AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com with an IAM user role that has the necessary permissions. For details, see link:#_planning_the_deployment[Planning the deployment] earlier in this guide.
. Make sure that your AWS account is configured correctly, as discussed in the link:#_technical_requirements[Technical requirements] section.

=== Subscribe to the {partner-product-short-name}

This Quick Start requires a subscription to the SaaS offering for {partner-product-short-name} in AWS Marketplace.

. Sign in to your AWS account.
. Open the page for the {marketplace_listing_url}[{partner-product-short-name} SaaS offering in AWS Marketplace^], and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.
. Select the _Contract Duration_, set the _Renewal Settings_, select the _Contract Options_ to be activated with your contract, and select *Create contract* button.

. You will be prompted to confirm the contract. If you agree to the pricing, select the *Pay Now* button. This will redirect you to the Conformity portal.
. After redirection to the Conformity portal, continue to create your account. During the account creation process you will be prompted to choose a region in which to host your data. Most organizations choose the region closest to the majority of their workloads. Some other organizations may have compliance requirements which drive their region selection.
. Once your account has been created, you can log into the UI. From the Cloud One home page, select the Conformity tile. Skip the wizard which prompts addition of your first AWS account; the AWS Control Tower integration will manage this on your behalf.

. Instead of using the wizard in the console, we will be automating the process of adding all current and future AWS Control Tower Accounts to the Conformity console.
. In the Conformity console, click the arrow next to your name in the top right corner, then select ‘User settings’ followed by ‘API Keys’ from the left navigation and create a new API key. Be sure to save this string as it cannot be retrieved later. This key will be used to authenticate the automation from the AWS Control Tower Master to the Conformity API. More details on generating an API key can be found https://cloudconformity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HELP/pages/77463659/Public+API+-+API+Keys[here^].

^|http://qs_template_permalink[View template^]
|===
. Check the AWS Region that’s displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary, to ensure that the selected region is same where AWS Control Tower was deployed. 
. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. For details on each parameter, see the link:#_parameter_reference[Parameter reference] section of this guide. When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose *Next*.
. The template requires 2 parameters; the first is the API Key generated in *Subscribe to the Cloud One Conformity AMI* section, and the second is the region selected when creating your Conformity account.
