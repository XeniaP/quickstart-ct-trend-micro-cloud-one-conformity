* An account administrator enrolls new or existing AWS accounts in AWS Control Tower, which generates a lifecycle event.
* The life cycle event invokes the life cycle Lambda function via an Amazon EventBridge rule.
* The life cycle Lambda function creates an Identity Access Management (IAM) cross-account role in the newly created AWS account.
* The life cycle Lambda function registers the new AWS account with the {partner-product-short-name} endpoint, calling external APIs.
* The API keys that are used to authenticate with the {partner-product-short-name} endpoint are stored in AWS Secrets Manager in the management account.
